# AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System

An interactive Streamlit web application that automates resume screening and ranking using a combination of classical NLP techniques and generative AI. The application extracts text from PDF resumes, processes the content using spaCy, computes quantitative similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity, and leverages Googleâ€™s Gemini-1.5 Pro model to provide qualitative suitability scores.

## Overview

Recruitment processes are often overwhelmed with high volumes of resumes, making manual screening time-consuming and error-prone. This project addresses the problem by:

- Extracting text from uploaded PDF resumes.
- Cleaning and processing the extracted text using spaCy.
- Computing resume-job description similarity using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
- Integrating generative AI (Gemini-1.5 Pro) to generate qualitative suitability scores.
- Displaying ranked resumes in an intuitive Streamlit interface.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Resume Upload:** Easily upload one or multiple PDF resumes.
- **Job Description Input:** Enter a job description for candidate matching.
- **Text Extraction & NLP Processing:** Automatic text extraction from PDFs and text normalization using spaCy.
- **Hybrid Ranking:** Combines quantitative analysis (TF-IDF) with qualitative insights from Gemini-1.5 Pro.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
- **Environment Configuration:** Secure API key management via a `.env` file.
